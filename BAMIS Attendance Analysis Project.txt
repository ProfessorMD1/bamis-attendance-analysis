 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes 1.16 million attendance records from Northern Nigerian primary schools to predict student absenteeism patterns. Using machine learning (Random Forest + SMOTE), we identify key drivers like farming seasons, market days, and gender disparities, achieving 55% prediction accuracy.

👉 Key Features:
- Machine Learning Pipeline: Predicts absenteeism risk factors
- Geospatial Analysis: Visualizes trends across 13 Northern states
- Policy Recommendations: Data-driven interventions for education stakeholders

 🚀 Quick Start

 🔍 Key Findings
- 16.6% absenteeism rate with peaks during farming seasons
- Male students in Primary 5-6 show highest absence rates (27%)
- Friday market days significantly impact attendance
- Model achieves 55% accuracy (46% recall for absentees)
